This is an image editing program.  It currently allows you to open an image and create a grayscale version.  You can choose to save the new grayscale image or clear the image from view.  The program will save any image as a PNG file.

The program runs through the Main class and should not need any unique files to compile.  As of Sept. 4, 2019, there are no known bugs.
